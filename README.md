# StarsignJS

ðŸŒŸ The _best_ web framework, just like astrology, it's real. ðŸŒŸ

### Creating a StarsignJS project

To create a StarsignJS project, just clone this repo!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:madelynwith5ns/StarsignJS <project-name>
cd <project-name>
# Remove the existing .git directory
rm -rf .git
# Make a git repository!
git init
```

_WIP: Soon you will be able to use the create-starsign-app app that will do this for you_

### Running StarsignJS

To run your StarsignJS project, use the `justfile`!

```bash
just run
```

This will compile and run your project!

### Meet the Stack

StarsignJS uses a carefully handcrafted set of technologies to deliver the
utmost in web development quality straight to your editor. Since we're the new
people on the framework block, we decided to really get in the mind of the
existing framework creators by enjoying their favorite programming fuel: we
mixed up several _definitely_ advertiser friendly substances and beverages into
the unholy slurpee of creation that is our ~~monologue~~framework-making juice.
Using this wonderful potion of web design enlightenment, we carefully observed
the stacks used by _your_ favorite web frameworks and metaframeworks and stacks
and metaomegagigasuperframeworks (special shoutout to the T3 stack, we couldn't
have come up with _half_ of what we made here without such a lovely example),
to create the greatest stack of all time. And without further adieu, allow us
to present to you, The StarsignJS Stack:

-   **TypeScript for the backend** We picked a modern backend language to provide
    a blissful experience for writing your backends. We also use TypeScript as the
    build system everywhere in this project, to keep it all nice and unified.

-   **C++ to generate the HTML** We use a fast, high-performance language to
    generate the HTML to describe your websites.

-   **WebFuck for the Frontend** We use a **blazingly fast** modern language that
    to ensure that your users have the blazingly fast experience that they
    webfucking deserve!

-   **Bash to generate the CSS** We tried to stick as close to the source as
    possible, thats why we picked the closest thing we could get to the write-only
    madness that is CSS. Bash is an ancient, low-performance language, _perfect_
    for generating CSS. We strongly believe that the performance cost of using bash
    is acceptable in this case because of the improved DX it will provide.

-   **Bun as the Runtime** We heard Bun is fast, and we know developers like fast,
    so it's Buntime for the Runtime!

-   **Just as the other build system** We also used Just for some of the build
    stuff.

### Documentation?

StarsignJS values minimalism. Documentation is an unncessary cluttering of the
codebase. StarsignJS strives to make its code _readable_ and _self-documenting_
so that you don't need documentation. As such, there is none.

### License?

To ensure you have the best experience possible, we use a license everyone is
familiar with and loves!

The Nuclear Waste Software License!

Because we at StarsignJS believe that projects should use a license that states
in the name what the project is, and StarsignJS is just like any other web
framework (except better!)! StarsignJS strives above all to not be a change of
paradigm from existing frameworks you're used to, thats why we have the _most_
clusterfucked set of tools and technologies ever, solving problems that don't
exist. We firmly believe all web developers will feel comfortable in this
environment.

You can view the license in the LICENSE.md file!
